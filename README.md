# Iago Sousa's Dot Files

This is a repository that i just made to begin saving all my dotfiles.

 The main reason i'm doing this is that I have found myself doing this more than i would like to in the past 2 years either on a new computer, or because i formatted mine or even installing for a friend or teaching him how to do it.
 
 This will serve any purpose for either having my files saved and as a public document for anyone to see the process that I took

 I will try to keep it updated as a documentation style so that you can find my step by step in each kind.

 Also will be addind my linux dotfiles once I get back into using linux (I'm having a little break from linux for now to be outside of my comfort zone).
